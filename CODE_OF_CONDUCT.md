# Code of Conduct

Be cool.

This project is open to everyone. We want a friendly, productive environment.

## The Rules
1.  **Be Respectful**: Disagreement is fine; personal attacks are not. Treat others as you'd like to be treated.
2.  **Focus on Code**: We're here to build great software. Keep discussions technical and constructive.
3.  **No Harassment**: Zero tolerance for abuse of any kind.

If you see something bad, report it to the maintainers. We'll handle it.
